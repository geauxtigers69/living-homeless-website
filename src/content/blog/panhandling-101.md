If you read the title of this post and groaned, you are not alone. Despite the popular belief of your drunk uncle - who believes that we all love holding a tattered cardboard sign begging for money while he shouts at us to get off our lazy asses and get a job, even though he lives off of unemployment and lives with your Grandma - nobody actually enjoys the act of panhandling.

## Lesson #1: We all hate panhandling - everyone of us

Flying a sign is a necessary evil to surviving the streets - each and everyone of us absolutely loathes the time of day when we have to pick up our signs, go smile and wave at 5 o'clock traffic while it hurdles towards us on the median, threatening to crush us homeless panhandlers into lifeless street pancakes. That's if we can find a spot to post up with our signs after struggling to beat the other panhandlers to the busiest and most dangerous spot.

No, we do not enjoy having to beg for money and food from people who are either (a) super kind and giving to the point you almost feel bad asking, or (b) are literally disturbed by the fact that you are existing in their reality, looking desperate with a cardboard sign. The sad truth is that you can apply the [80-20 Rule](#80-20 rule link) here with a slight adjustment: 10% of people are super kind and 90% of people are really awful. Panhandling can be humiliating, degrading, and flat out soul crushing at times, especially when you make no money and people yell at you to get off the curb and get a job.

A side note - news for y'all: sometimes we can't "just get a job". For example, I don't have an ID and the DMV won't give me mine without digging up a bunch of old files - oh, and I also haven't had a real shower in two months and can't get hired without two forms of ID. So spare your comments and stop heckling homeless panhandlers.

Back to the main point - we have created a Panhandling 101 tutorial for y'all so hopefully you will make some decent money and won't feel like killing yourself after holding a sign in front of Walmart for a few hours. Read our guide to become a sign flying pro and line your pockets up with everyone elses hard earned cash.
