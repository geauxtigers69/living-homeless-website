One of the worst days of my nerdy, adult life was a couple months ago. Lisa and I had spent too much time in the hot, southern North Carolina heat and consumed something that gave us a stomach bug. We spent hours getting sick outside of a Barnes and Noble before somebody called 911 and the emergency response team came and whisked us away.

What's the problem you might ask? Well, during this whole ordeal it just so happened that my $1,200 Airsus Zenbook was left behind (with my glasses, cell phone, and wallet) and you can bet that some other street urchin came and scooped that up in a heartbeat, leaving me without a way to code or do anything really as a matter of fact. 

## Losing Your Way of Life

I was destroyed; I felt hopeless. Not having my main tool for work, creativity, organization, and play made me feel as if I were a naked fool, laid bare for the rest of the world to scoff at and treat like some type of primitive human-like ape species who doesn't understand the purpose of his own thumbs.

It took a long month of flying signs, asking people for help, and begging Lisa for the opportunity to get the machine that is so vital to utilizing my main skill set back in my hands. The path to digital redemption was a long, difficult journey that I do not care to reminisce on much longer - there were many nights spent alone, crying naked in the fetal position while wondering what updates the [Deno runtime](https://deno.com) had released during my absence.

This miserable journey was fortunately very educational and while I learned a lot about who I am as a 32-year old coding-junkie-tech-nerd, I learned even more about getting your tech stack going on a serious budget! Read on and I'll tell you how to get your cell phone back (and the service turned on), where to source a cheap (maybe even free) computer, and how you can seriously hack a super sweet tech setup for minimal cost with a little effort.

## Hacking the Discounted Tech Stack

Let's discuss how you can get your hardware for cheap with some of these deals and marketplaces you'll want to search first, then we'll talk about some ways you can operate your business and utilize coding resources for free.
