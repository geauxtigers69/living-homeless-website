# Living Homeless Website

Welcome to the Living Homeless Website GitHub repository! This is where all the magic happens when it comes to updating our little project. We would love your help or Andrew would love to share any help you may need when utilizing this repository.

This website was created to help us get out of our current situation and also help others who may find themselves homeless, and like us, unsure of how to take care of yourself when you hit the streets. It is a scary time when you lose your home and we understand what it's like and are here to help you survive and thrive in your current situation.

Any questions can be directed to us through our contact us page on the website or you may submit an issue on this repository and we will try to get back to you as soon as possible.

Any and all contributions are welcome and Any monetary donations can be directed currently to our cash app $lisaweisbeck4 and you will receive a email receipt for your records and tax keeping purposes. Donations are tax deductible and are used to help people currently struggling with homelessness.

We are working on other ways that you can contribute to this project so stay tuned and you can find any current issues we are working on on our project page. We thank you for your interest in the living homeless project and hope you enjoy our website!
